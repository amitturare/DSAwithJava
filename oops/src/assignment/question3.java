    Q3. Create a class Medicine to represent a drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical
    company. Provide a function displayLabel() in this class to print Name and address of
    the company.

    Derive Tablet, Syrup and Ointment classes from the Medicine class.
    Override the displayLabel() function in each of these classes to print additional
    information suitable to the type of medicine.

    For example, in case of tablets, it could be "store in a cool dry place", in case of
    ointments it could be "for external use only" etc. Create a class TestMedicine . Write
    main function to do the following: Declare an array of Medicine references of size 10
    Create a medicine object of the type as decided by a randomly generated integer in the
    range 1 to 3. Refer Java API Documentation to find out random generation features.
    Check the polymorphic behavior of the displayLabel() method.
