    Q2. Create an abstract class Instrument which has the abstract function play.
    Create three more subclasses from Instrument which are Piano, Flute, Guitar.
    Override the play method inside all three classes printing a message . "Piano is playing
    tan tan tan tan " for Piano class "Flute is playing toot toot toot toot" for Flute class
    "Guitar is playing tin tin tin " for Guitar class

    You must not allow the user to declare an object of Instrument class. Create an array of
    10 Instruments. Assign different types of instrument to Instrument reference. Check for
    the polymorphic behavior of the play method. Use the instanceof operator to print which
    object stored at which index of instrument array.
