/*
    Q4)Suppose you are designing a system to manage employees in a company. You have
    a superclass Employee and two subclasses FullTimeZmp10yee and PartTimeZmp10yee.
    The Employee class contains attributes such as name, ld, and methods like
    calculateSalary(), displayDetails() . Both FullTimeZmp10yee and
    PartTimeEmployee inherit from the Employee Class.

    Implement the Employee class with appropriate attributes and methods.
    Implement the FullTimeEmp10yee class that inherits from Employee and adds
    specific attributes/methods related to full-time employees, such as salary,
    benefits.

    Implement the PartTimeEmp10yee class that inherits from Employee and adds
    specific attributes/methods related to part-time employees, such as hourlyRate,
    hour sWorked.

    Bonus:
    Implement a TestEmp10yee class with a main method to create instances of
    FullTimeEmp10yee and PartTimeEmp10yee, demonstrate inheritance, and call
    methods from both the superclass and subclasses.
